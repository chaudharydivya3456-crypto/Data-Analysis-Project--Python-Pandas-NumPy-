      Urban Traffic Accident Hotspot Detection

 Urban areas around the world are experiencing a steady increase in traffic density due to population growth, 
 urbanization, and rising vehicle ownership. 
 With more vehicles on the road, traffic accidents have become a major public safety and economic concern, 
 causing fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

 The Urban Traffic Accident Hotspot Detection project focuses on leveraging data-driven approaches to identify areas (hotspots)  
 and time periods that   are highly prone to accidents. 
 By using datasets from city open data portals, IoT traffic sensors, and historical accident records, 
 this project combines geospatial analytics, time-series analysis, and visualization to generate actionable insights.
